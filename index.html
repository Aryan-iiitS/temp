            <h2>About Chandrayaan</h2>
            <p>
                The Chandrayaan programme, also known as the Indian Lunar Exploration Programme, is an ongoing series of outer space missions by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) for the exploration of the Moon. The program incorporates lunar orbiters, impactors, soft landers, and rovers. The Chandrayaan missions aim to enhance our understanding of the Moon's composition, surface features, and potential resources like water.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                The Indian space programme began with modest objectives and no intentions of undertaking sophisticated extraterrestrial missions. It was only after ISRO developed the capability to create satellites and orbital launch vehicles like PSLV that India began to explore lunar missions in the early 2000s. The idea of a lunar mission was first raised in 1999 during a meeting of the Indian Academy of Sciences and was followed up by the Astronautical Society of India in 2000.

        <!-- History -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                In 2003, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced the Chandrayaan project, which was later approved in the same year. The mission was initially aimed at launching a lunar orbiter to conduct chemical and mineralogical mapping of the Moon's surface. The Chandrayaan-1 mission, launched in 2008, successfully orbited the Moon and made significant discoveries, including confirming the presence of water molecules on the Moon's surface.

            <h2>Second Mission</h2>
            <p>
                The Chandrayaan-2 mission, initially targeted for launch in 2012, was delayed multiple times and finally launched in 2019. Unlike Chandrayaan-1, Chandrayaan-2 had an orbiter, a lander named Vikram, and a rover named Pragyan. The mission aimed to land on the lunar south pole. Unfortunately, the Vikram lander lost communication with the ground during the landing attempt.

            <p>
                ISRO initially collaborated with Russia for Chandrayaan-2, with Russia tasked with providing the lander. However, delays in Russia's lander development and technical challenges led ISRO to take on full responsibility for the mission, including developing the lander independently.

            <p>
                Following the breakdown of the Russia-India collaboration, ISRO developed the Vikram lander indigenously. A testing facility in Challakere, Karnataka, was established to simulate lunar conditions. The lander was designed to land softly on the lunar surface and deploy the Pragyan rover.

                The Chandrayaan-2 mission was launched on 22 July 2019 aboard a GSLV Mk III rocket. Despite the Vikram lander's failed soft landing, the orbiter successfully entered lunar orbit and continues to send valuable data back to Earth.
